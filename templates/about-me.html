<h1>About Me</h1>
    <b1>Hi, I'm Adam Horvitz and I am in 11th grade this year at North Broward Preparatory School! I am planning on majoring in computer science/engineering in college. Outside of school, I frequently volunteer at food drives for the needy, ocean cleanups, and at my sister's elementary school. I love learning about computers and engineering. I also frequently ride my bike and go swimming. I have family all around the country in many states.
